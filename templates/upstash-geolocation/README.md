# Upstash GeoLocation

The **Upstash GeoLocation** template is an automation designed to deploy a database directly on the edge while enabling the configuration of custom messages that will be delivered according to the user's geographical location.

These messages are delivered through a static interface, based on HTML and generated by the template after deployment. 

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. The template also incorporates a file with location-based greetings, which are retrieved from the integration with Upstash.

For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template via Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM), check the [How to use the Upstash GeoLocation EdgeDeploy template through Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/upstash-geolocation-edgedeploy/) guide.

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

1. Create an [Azion account](https://manager.azion.com/signup).
2. Create an [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/login).
3. Create a Global Database for the best available edge latency in the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/).
4. Generate your GitHub personal token.
* While generating your personal token, grant that your scope has the permission to authorize an OAuth app or a personal token to access to public and private repositories, including read and write access to code. You must also enable the workflow option to allow adding and updating GitHub Actions workflow files.

Note that permissions can be scoped either to a user, an organization, or to a repository. Read the [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) documentation for more information.

## Usage information

To start using the **Upstash GeoLocation** template, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
- If you don’t have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the homepage, select the **Start with a template** option.
3. Find the **Upstash GeoLocation** card and select it.
4. Click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration section.

## Settings

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **Upstash Redis Rest URL** *: the URL to access your Upstash database using REST.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` in your database page.
- **Upstash Redis Rest Token** *: the token to authorize access to your Upstash database using REST. 
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in your database page.
- **GitHub Personal Token** *: your GitHub personal token.

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

Upstash GeoLocation creates a new Azion edge application and its domain. It also creates an edge function to provide the arguments for the geolocation, a new repository in your GitHub account based on a [public template](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/upstash-geolocation), and a static interface to exhibit the messages.

In this function, the `upstash/redis` library is integrated, connecting to your Upstash Global Database and retrieving the message based on the user's location. This location is taken from the metadata `["geoip_country_code"]`.

The template also incorporates location-based greetings in your database, which are retrieved from the integration with Upstash, similar to this:

```bash
Welcome to Upstash CLI

set BR "Olá, tudo bem!"
OK
set GB "Ey up?"
OK
set US "Yo, what’s up?"
OK
set IN "Namaste"
OK
```
You can customize these greetings on your Upstash database to attend to your necessities.

##Important

To guarantee the optimal performance of this template, it's necessary to activate:

* [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/)
* [Application Acceleration](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/)

You must activate them separately via RTM. To do so, review the [Azion documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/upstash-geolocation-edgedeploy/).

If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by Upstash usage will be processed and billed separately on the Upstash platform. Visit the [Upstash documentation](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/globaldatabase#pricing) for more details.

## Management

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM). Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your Upstash account and database.

To manage and edit your edge application’s settings, read the documentation about [managing edge applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details. For specific Upstash-related questions, check the [Upstash documentation](https://docs.upstash.com/).

### Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can edit and update your args and code in the edge function, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll need first to *declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository* to complete the second build with the changes. When the second build is finished, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit the args as desired.

To do so, open your **Upstash GeoLocation EdgeDeploy** repository on GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action to add your variables**, following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
- Read [how to generate an Azion personal token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```

2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....

```

3. Add the Redis Database access credentials to the *secrets*, being:

- **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL**: the URL to access your Upstash database using REST.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` in your database page.
- **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN**: the token to authorize access to your Upstash database using REST.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in your database page.

```bash
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<value>
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<value>;
```

4. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml
 - name: Create args file
    run: |
        ...
        "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL": "${{ secrets.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL }}",
        "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN": "${{ secrets.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN }}",
        ...
```

5. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository. 

### Custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it. Go to the [Domains](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) documentation to read more about it.
