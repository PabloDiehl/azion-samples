## Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can edit it and update it, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll need first to *declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository* to complete the second build with the changes. When the second build is completed, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit the args as desired.

To do so, open your repository in GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action** to [add your variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
- Read [how to generate an Azion personal token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```

2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....

```

3. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository. 

## Management

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using [Azion Console)](https://console.azion.com/).

To manage and edit your edge applicationâ€™s settings, read the documentation about [managing edge applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it. Go to the [Domains](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/)  documentation to read more about it.
